# Tasks: 项目基础设施搭建和开发环境配置

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-dev-env-setup/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/api-contracts.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: The examples below include test tasks. Tests are REQUIRED for this development environment feature to ensure reliability and cross-platform compatibility.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/`, `scripts/` at repository root
- **Docker configuration**: `docker/`, `docker-compose.yml`
- **AI services**: `ai-services/`, `prisma/`
- **CI/CD**: `.github/workflows/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - Required for AI data storage
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Requires some code for testing
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational + US3 (database) - Requires database for AI metadata

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (TDD approach)
- Database models before API endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, user stories can start in parallel
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Development Environment Setup)

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Contract test for development environment health check in tests/integration/test-dev-env-health.ts"
Task: "Integration test for setup script execution in tests/integration/test-setup-scripts.ts"
Task: "Cross-platform compatibility test in tests/integration/test-cross-platform.ts"

# Launch all implementation tasks for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create Docker development environment configuration in docker-compose.dev.yml"
Task: "Setup hot reload development configuration in next.config.js"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1-3 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Environment Setup)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Code Quality)
5. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 (Database)
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test core development environment independently
7. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1-3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 4 (CI/CD) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 5 (AI Integration) → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Complete Polish phase → Production ready

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers (1-5 team members):

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Environment Setup)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Code Quality)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Database)
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (CI/CD)
   - Developer E: User Story 5 (AI Integration)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD approach)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- This is a development environment feature - reliability and cross-platform compatibility are critical
- All tasks should include comprehensive error handling and user-friendly feedback
