# Tasks: 产品UI/UX设计

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-ui-ux/` **Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md,
research.md, data-model.md, contracts/ui-components.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Tests are included as UI component testing and accessibility testing are critical for
this feature

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing
of each story

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] [FR-XXX] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- **[FR-XXX]**: Which functional requirement this task implements
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

- Paths follow Next.js 15 app router structure
- Components: `src/components/ui/`, `src/components/features/`, `src/components/layout/`
- Types: `src/types/`
- Utils: `src/lib/`
- Tests: `tests/components/`, `tests/e2e/`, `tests/accessibility/`

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Stories 1 & 2 (P1): Can start after Foundational - Priority MVP
  - User Stories 3 & 4 (P2): Can start after Foundational - Enhanced features
  - User Story 5 (P3): Can start after other stories - Mobile optimization
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - May integrate with US1 but independently
  testable
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Depends on US1 for note data
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Cross-cutting but independently testable
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Should start after other stories - Optimizes existing components

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Base UI components before feature components
- Layout components before page components
- State management before component integration
- Core implementation before responsive optimization
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

#### Phase 1 Parallel Tasks:

```bash
# All setup tasks can run together:
Task: "Create UI/UX project structure"
Task: "Initialize Next.js 15 + React 19 + TypeScript project"
Task: "Configure Tailwind CSS and CSS variables"
Task: "Configure TypeScript paths and strict mode"
Task: "Setup Vitest + React Testing Library configuration"
```

#### Phase 2 Parallel Tasks:

```bash
# Foundation tasks can run together:
Task: "Setup design tokens and CSS variables system"
Task: "Configure theme provider system"
Task: "Setup state management with Zustand"
Task: "Create utility functions for theme and UI utilities"
Task: "Setup Next.js 15 app router structure"
```

#### User Story 1 Parallel Tasks:

```bash
# Base UI components can be created together:
Task: "Create Button component"
Task: "Create Input component"
Task: "Create Card component"
Task: "Create Textarea component"
Task: "Create Badge component"

# Tests can run in parallel:
Task: "Button component accessibility test"
Task: "Input component contract test"
Task: "Card component responsive test"
Task: "Note editor integration test"
Task: "Note editor accessibility test"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 & 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Note creation/editing)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Search functionality)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test core user workflows independently
6. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
6. Add User Story 5 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (1-2 days)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (note editing) - P1
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (search) - P1
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (AI analysis) - P2
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. User Story 4 (settings) and User Story 5 (mobile) can be handled sequentially or by rotating team
   members

## Critical Path Analysis

### Must Complete Before Any UI Work:

- T001-T011 (Setup + Foundational phases)

### MVP Critical Path (User Stories 1 & 2):

- T012-T036 (User Story 1 tests + implementation)
- T037-T047 (User Story 2 tests + implementation)

### Full Feature Critical Path:

- All tasks through T084 (all user stories)
- Polish tasks T085-T096 can be done in parallel with final testing

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD approach)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Accessibility testing is mandatory for all UI components
- Performance testing should be done after each major story completion
- Mobile responsiveness should be considered throughout implementation
