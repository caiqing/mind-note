**Branch**: `002-smart-note-management` | **Date**: 2025-10-25
**Focus**: Technology selection and architectural decisions for smart note management system

## Research Overview

This document outlines the technical research conducted for the smart note management feature, covering technology selection, architectural decisions, and implementation approach.

## Technology Evaluation

### Frontend Framework Options

| Framework | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|-----------|------|------|----------------|
| **Next.js 15** | ✅ App Router, Server Components, ✅ Built-in SEO, ✅ Great DX | ⚠️ Learning curve | ✅ **SELECTED** |
| Remix | ✅ Nested routing, ✅ Great performance | ❌ Smaller ecosystem, ⚠️ More complex | ❌ Rejected |
| Vite + React | ✅ Fast dev server, ✅ Modern tooling | ❌ Need to add routing, ❌ No SSR out of box | ❌ Rejected |

**Decision**: Next.js 15 App Router provides the best balance of features for our full-stack application with excellent SEO support and developer experience.

### Rich Text Editor Evaluation

| Editor | Features | Complexity | Integration | Recommendation |
|--------|----------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Tiptap** | ✅ ProseMirror-based, ✅ Extensible, ✅ React support | Medium | Easy | ✅ **SELECTED** |
| Slate.js | ✅ Highly customizable, ✅ Framework agnostic | High | Complex | ❌ Rejected |
| Draft.js | ✅ Facebook battle-tested, ✅ Good docs | Medium | React only | ❌ Rejected |
| Quill.js | ✅ Lightweight, ✅ Easy to use | Low | Limited features | ❌ Rejected |

**Decision**: Tiptap offers the best combination of features, extensibility, and React integration for our rich text editing needs.

### Database Technology Assessment

| Database | Vector Support | Performance | Scalability | Cost | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|-------------|-------------|------|----------------|
| **PostgreSQL + pgvector** | ✅ Native pgvector extension | ✅ Excellent | ✅ Proven | Open source | ✅ **SELECTED** |
| MongoDB + Atlas Vector | ✅ Built-in vector search | Good | ✅ Auto-scaling | Expensive | ❌ Rejected |
| Pinecone | ✅ Vector-optimized | ✅ Fast | ✅ Cloud-native | Expensive | ❌ Rejected |
| Weaviate | ✅ Graph + vectors | Good | ✅ Flexible | Complex setup | ❌ Rejected |

**Decision**: PostgreSQL with pgvector provides the best balance of traditional relational features with vector search capabilities at reasonable cost.

### AI Service Provider Comparison

| Provider | Model Quality | Cost | Rate Limits | Integration | Recommendation |
|----------|---------------|------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| **OpenAI** | ✅ Excellent (GPT-4) | Medium | Reasonable | ✅ Excellent | ✅ **SELECTED** |
| Anthropic Claude | ✅ Excellent (Claude-3) | Medium | Limited | ✅ Good | ⚠️ Alternative |
| Google Gemini | ✅ Good | Lower | Generous | ✅ Good | ⚠️ Alternative |
| Local Models (Ollama) | ✅ Free | ✅ Free | ✅ Unlimited | Complex | ❌ Fallback only |

**Decision**: OpenAI provides the best model quality and integration experience. Local models through Ollama will be used as fallback for privacy and cost control.

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Full-Stack Monolith with Clear Separation

**Rationale**: For a team of 1-5 developers, a monolithic approach provides:
- Simpler deployment and maintenance
- Shared codebase for frontend and backend logic
- Cost-effective hosting on single VPS
- Easier debugging and monitoring

**Structure**:
```
src/
├── app/          # Next.js App Router (Frontend + API)
├── components/   # React Components
├── lib/          # Shared utilities
├── hooks/        # React Hooks
└── types/        # TypeScript definitions
```

### 2. Hybrid Rendering Strategy

**Server Components**: For static content, SEO pages, and data fetching
**Client Components**: For interactive UI, rich text editing, and real-time features

**Benefits**:
- Optimal performance with server-side rendering
- Rich interactivity where needed
- Reduced client-side JavaScript bundle

### 3. Caching Strategy

**Multi-level caching approach**:
1. **Browser Cache**: Static assets and cached API responses
2. **CDN Cache**: Global content delivery
3. **Redis Cache**: Frequent database queries and AI responses
4. **Local Storage**: User preferences and offline content

## Performance Considerations

### Vector Search Optimization

```sql
-- Optimized vector search with proper indexing
CREATE INDEX ON notes USING ivfflat (embedding vector_l2_ops);
CREATE INDEX ON notes USING gin (to_tsvector('english', title || ' ' || content));

-- Hybrid search combining full-text and vector search
SELECT *,
       ts_rank(search_vector, query) as text_rank,
       1 - (embedding <=> query_vector) as vector_rank
FROM notes
WHERE search_vector @@ query
  OR (embedding <=> query_vector) < 0.7
ORDER BY (text_rank * 0.3 + vector_rank * 0.7) DESC;
```

### AI Processing Optimization

**Batch Processing Strategy**:
```typescript
// Intelligent batching for AI requests
class AIBatchProcessor {
  private queue: ProcessingRequest[] = []
  private processing = false

  async addToQueue(request: ProcessingRequest) {
    this.queue.push(request)
    if (!this.processing) {
      this.processBatch()
    }
  }

  private async processBatch() {
    this.processing = true
    while (this.queue.length > 0) {
      const batch = this.queue.splice(0, 10) // Process in batches of 10
      await this.processBatchItems(batch)
      await this.delay(1000) // Rate limiting
    }
    this.processing = false
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

### 1. Content Security
- **XSS Protection**: Sanitize all user content before storage
- **CSRF Protection**: Implement CSRF tokens for all mutating operations
- **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP headers for all pages

### 2. Data Privacy
- **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive content at rest and in transit
- **Data Anonymization**: Option for local AI processing
- **Access Control**: Row-level security for user data

### 3. API Security
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement per-user rate limiting
- **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs at API boundaries
- **Authentication**: Secure session management with NextAuth.js

## Cost Analysis

### Infrastructure Costs (Monthly Estimates)

| Service | Usage | Cost | Notes |
|---------|--------|------|-------|
| **VPS (DigitalOcean)** | 4GB RAM, 2 CPU | $24/month | Primary hosting |
| **Database (PostgreSQL)** | 10GB storage | $15/month | Managed service |
| **Redis Cache** | 1GB memory | $10/month | Session and data cache |
| **OpenAI API** | 1M tokens/month | ~$20/month | AI processing |
| **CDN (Cloudflare)** | 100GB bandwidth | $20/month | Static assets |
| **Total** | | **$89/month** | For 10,000 users |

### AI Cost Optimization Strategies

1. **Intelligent Caching**: Cache AI responses to avoid repeated processing
2. **Batch Processing**: Group similar requests to reduce API calls
3. **Local Fallback**: Use local models for simple categorization tasks
4. **User Tiers**: Implement usage limits for different user tiers

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| AI API rate limits | Medium | High | Implement intelligent batching + fallback |
| Vector search performance | Low | Medium | Proper indexing + caching |
| Rich text editor complexity | Medium | Medium | Choose proven solution (Tiptap) |
| Real-time collaboration | High | Low | Defer to future iteration |

### Business Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| AI processing costs | Medium | Medium | Cost controls + usage limits |
| User adoption | Low | High | Clear value demonstration |
| Data privacy concerns | Medium | High | Encryption + local processing option |
