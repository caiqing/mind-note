# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Required Gates (MindNote Constitution v1.0.0)

**AI-First Development (Principle I)**
- [ ] Feature includes explicit AI integration points
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms defined for AI service unavailability
- [ ] AI decision transparency for users is documented
- [ ] Data preparation strategy for AI processing is specified

**Specification-Driven Engineering (Principle II)**
- [ ] Complete specification exists via `/speckit.specify`
- [ ] All user stories are prioritized (P1, P2, P3)
- [ ] Measurable success criteria are defined
- [ ] Acceptance scenarios are explicit and testable

**Test-First with AI Validation (Principle III)**
- [ ] Unit test strategy defined for business logic (>90% coverage)
- [ ] AI-specific validation approach documented
- [ ] Integration test plan for AI services included
- [ ] Mock AI service strategy for unit testing specified

**Data Intelligence Integration (Principle IV)**
- [ ] Data models support vector embeddings
- [ ] Graph structures for relationship mapping included
- [ ] AI processing metadata fields defined
- [ ] Audit trails for AI decisions incorporated

**Observability & AI Performance (Principle V)**
- [ ] AI performance metrics defined (<3s responses)
- [ ] Latency targets specified (see Performance Standards)
- [ ] Logging strategy for AI interactions documented
- [ ] Cost tracking mechanisms planned

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
